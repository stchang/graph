@section{Graph properties}

The following forms associate properties with a graph. The graph itself is unchanged. These are inspired by and resemble the Boost Graph Library's @hyperlink["http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_42_0/libs/graph/doc/quick_tour.html"]{externally-stored properties}

  Creates a @deftech{vertex property} for vertices of the graph where each 
vertex maps to a value. This is a loose association, as keys of the mapping 
don't necessarily have to be vertices in the graph. 

Essentially, a vertex property is just a hash table with vertex keys that has
some convenient accessors. The accessors do not enforce
that vertices must be in the graph to support algorithms that make use of 
imaginary vertices.

    @item{@racket[prop-name]@racketidfont{-defined?}: Indicates whether the given vertex has an associated value.}
  ]
  
  If an @racket[#:init] argument is supplied, each vertex in the graph is 
  associated with the result of computing @racket[init-expr]. In the 
  @racket[init-expr], the identifier @racket[$v] may be used to refer to the 
  vertex whose value is being set. The @racket[init-expr] is evaluated only
  once. If vertices are added to the graph after the mapping is created, 
  those vertices will not have a value in the mapping until the setter is called.
  
  A @racket[#:vs] argument maybe supplied to specify the order in which the vertices are initialized. The @racket[vs] list is only used if there is also an @racket[#:init] expression.

Generalized breadth-first search. Partially inspired by the C++ Boost Graph 
Library. See Lee et al. OOPSLA 1999 @cite["GGCL"]. Here is the rough implementation:
@racketblock[  
  (enqueue! Q s)
  (mark-discovered! s)
  (define new-acc
    (for/fold ([acc (init G s)]) ([u (in-queue Q)])
      (for ([inner-acc (visit G s u acc)])
        ([v (in-neighbors G u)] #:when (visit? G s u v) #:break (break? G s u v))
        (mark-discovered! v)
        (begin0 (discover G s u v inner-acc)
                (enqueue! Q v)))))
  (finish G s new-acc)]
Utilizes a queue that implements @racket[gen:queue]. A vertex is 
@deftech{discovered} when it gets added to the queue. If no 
@racket[custom-visit?-fn] is provided, then the default behavior is to not 
enqueue/visit vertices that have already been discovered (ie seen). The function
checks the @racket[#:break] condition when a vertex is discovered (ie being 
considered for enqueueing). When a vertex is dequeued,
then @racket[visit] is called. The result of @racket[bfs/generalized] is the result 
of @racket[finish].

An accumulator is threaded through all the functions and returned at the end.
The initial accumulator value is the result of applying @racket[init]. By 
default the accumulator is threaded through @racket[discover], @racket[visit], 
and is returned via @racket[finish].

Accumulator history: @history[#:added "0.2"]}

Cleaner syntax for @racket[bfs/generalized]. Essentially, this form eliminates 
the need to define separate functions and then pass them as
@racket[bfs/generalized]'s keyword arguments. Instead, the bodies of those 
functions are inserted right after the corresponding keywords.

Each possible keyword has a colon-suffixed and non-colon-suffixed version. The
non-colon-suffixed versions bind user-supplied identifiers. For example, the
keywords @racket[#:break], @racket[#:visit?], @racket[#:discover], and 
@racket[#:visit] bind identifiers that represent the vertices under
consideration. For some keywords, the accumulator may also be named. 
If the accumulator is unnamed, then it is implicitly passed through unchanged.
If the accumulator is named, then the result of evaluating the body becomes
the new accumulator value.

In the body of colon-suffixed keywords, implicit special identifiers refer 
to the vertices under consideration. Specifically, @racket[$v] is bound to the 
current vertex and @racket[$from] is its parent (when appropriate). A 
@racket[$to] identifier has the same value as @racket[$v], in case that name 
makes more sense in the context of the program. 
The special @racket[$acc] identifier represents the accumulator value.

Colon-suffixed keyword history: @history[#:added "0.3"]}

The keywords that don't bind any names (@racket[#:init-queue] and @racket[#:init])
have both colon and non-colon versions, to have a consistent naming scheme.

The keywords @racket[#:visit?], @racket[#:discover], and @racket[#:visit] also
have alternate names, @racket[#:enqueue?], @racket[#:on-enqueue], and 
@racket[#:on-dequeue], respectively, which can be used when these names are more
appropriate, for program readability.

In any of the keyword arguments, the special identifiers @racket[$discovered?],
@racket[$seen?], and @racket[$visited?] are also available, where 
@racket[($seen? v)] indicates whether the vertex has been seen, ie whether the 
vertex has ever been added to the queue (@racket[($discovered? v)] is the same 
as @racket[$seen?]), and @racket[($visited? v)] indicates whether the vertex has
been visited, ie pulled off the queue.

In the @racket[#:return] expressions, the @racket[$broke?] special identifier
indicates whether the search was terminated early according to the 
@racket[#:break] condition.

For example, below is Dijkstra's algorithm, implemented with @racket[do-bfs]. 
The code defines two @tech{vertex property}s: @racket[d] maps a vertex to the 
currently known shortest distance from the source and @racket[π] maps a vertex 
to its predecessor in the shortest path from the source. The algorithm utilizes 
a priority queue (ie, heap) that is sorted according to intermediate shortest 
paths. A node is added to the heap when it improves one of the paths. The 
algorithm makes use of the special identifiers @racket[$v] and @racket[$from].

Generalized depth-first search. Partially inspired by the C++ Boost Graph 
Library. See Lee et al. OOPSLA 1999 @cite["GGCL"]. Here is the rough 
implementation:

@#reader scribble/comment-reader (racketblock
  ;; inner loop: keep following (unvisited) links
  (define (do-visit parent u acc)
    (mark-visited! u)
    (define new-acc
      (for/fold ([acc (prologue G parent u acc)])
                ([v (in-neighbors G u)] #:break (break? G u v))
        (cond [(visit? G u v) (do-visit u v acc)]
              [(process-unvisited? G u v) (process-unvisited G u v acc)]
              [else acc])))
    (epilogue G parent u new-acc))
  
  ;; outer loop: picks a new vertex to continue with when search reaches dead end
  (define new-acc 
    (for/fold ([acc (init G)]) 
              ([u (order (get-vertices G))] #:break (break? G #f u))
      (cond [(visit? G #f u) (combine (do-visit #f u (inner-init acc)) acc)]
            [(process-unvisited? G #f u) (process-unvisited G #f u acc)]
            [else acc])))
  
  (finish G new-acc))

The @racket[do-visit] function is the inner loop that keeps following edges, 
depth-first, until the search gets stuck. The "visit" part of the code is 
separated into two functions, the @racket[prologue], which represents the 
descending part of the visit, and @racket[epilogue], which gets called on the 
way back up. The outer @racket[for/fold] loop picks a new vertex to restart the 
search when it gets stuck. Vertices that are already visited are marked and are 
not visited again by default, but the @racket[custom-visit?-fn] can override this. 
The algorithm terminates when all vertices are visited, or 
the @racket[#:break] condition is triggered. The 
result of @racket[dfs/generalized] is the result of @racket[finish]. 

An accumulator is threaded through all the functions and returned at the end.
The initial accumulator value is the result of applying @racket[init]. There is
another @racket[inner-init] value that starts a new sub-accumulator each time the
outer @racket[for/fold] loop iterates. The optional @racket[combine] function
combines the result of each outer loop iteration with the overall accumulator.
See the implementation of @racket[cc] for an example of where this is useful.
If a different @racket[inner-init] is unneeded, it defaults to the same value as
the overall accumulator.

Accumulator history: @history[#:added "0.2"]

If an @racket[order] function is supplied, the outer loop uses it to sort the
vertices before determining which vertex to visit next. The @racket[break?] 
predicate aborts the search and returns when it is true. 
@racket[process-unvisited?] and @racket[process-unvisited] specify code to run 
when a vertex is not visited.

The functions that require both a "from" and a "to" vertex argument are given 
@racket[#f] for the "from" (ie the parent) when there is none.

Analogous to @racket[do-bfs]. Nicer syntax for @racket[dfs/generalized]. 
Essentially, this form eliminates the need to define separate functions and 
then pass them as @racket[dfs/generalized]'s keyword arguments. Instead, the 
bodies of those functions are inserted right after the corresponding keywords.

Each possible keyword has a colon-suffixed and non-colon-suffixed version. The
non-colon-suffixed versions bind user-supplied identifiers. For example, the
keywords @racket[#:break], @racket[#:visit?], @racket[#:prologue],
@racket[#:epilogue], @racket[#:process-unvisited?], and @racket[#:process-unvisited]
bind identifiers that represent the vertices under consideration. For some keywords, 
the accumulator may also be named. 
If the accumulator is unnamed, then it is implicitly passed through unchanged.
If the accumulator is named, then the result of evaluating the body becomes
the new accumulator value.

In the body of colon-suffixed keywords, implicit special identifiers refer
to the vertices under consideration. Specifically, @racket[$v] is bound to the 
current vertex and @racket[$from] is its parent (when appropriate). A 
@racket[$to] identifier has the same value as @racket[$v], in case that name 
makes more sense in the context of the program. 
The special @racket[$acc] identifier represents the accumulator value.

Colon-suffixed keyword history: @history[#:added "0.3"]}

The keywords that don't bind any names (@racket[#:order], @racket[#:init], 
@racket[#:iinit], and @racket[#:combine])
have both colon and non-colon versions, to have a consistent naming scheme.

In the @racket[#:return] expressions, the @racket[$broke?] special identifier
indicates whether the search was terminated early according to the 
@racket[#:break] condition.

As an example, here is a possible definition for  @racket[dag?], 
a predicate that indicates whether a graph is directed and 
acyclic. The function uses the classic three vertex coloring, where white 
indicates unseen, gray indicates discovered, and black indicates done. 
Encountering a gray node while searching indicates a cycle so this is 
checked as the @racket[#:break] condition. The implementation of @racket[dag?]
uses the special @racket[$v] and @racket[$broke?] identifiers.

Computes all-pairs shortest paths using Johnson's algorithm. Should be faster than Floyd Warshall for sparse graphs. Theoretical running time is O(VElogV).

Handles negative weights by first running @racket[bellman-ford]. The uses @racket[dijkstra] for each vertex in the graph.

Note, the running time could be theoretically faster with a version of Dijkstra that uses a Fibonacci heap instead of a standard heap.}


@; graph coloring -------------------------------------------------------------

Graph coloring functions are only valid for undirected graphs.

@section[#:tag "coloring"]{Graph Coloring}

@defproc[(coloring [g graph?] [num-colors natural-number/c] [#:order order (-> list? list?) (λ (x) x)])
         (or/c (hash/c any/c number? #:immutable #f) #f)]{
Returns a coloring for the given graph using at most the specified number of
colors, or @racket[#f] if no coloring is possible. Uses backtracking algorithm
so takes exponential time. Optional @racket[#:order] parameter determines the
order in which verticies are colored.

The returned "colors" are integers in @tt{[0,num-colors)}.}
                                                                                        
@defproc[(coloring/greedy 
          [g graph?] 
          [#:order order (or/c 'smallest-last (-> list? list?)) 'smallest-last])
         (values number? (hash/c any/c number? #:immutable #f))]{
Returns a "greedy" coloring of the given graph, where the color for a vertex is
the "smallest" color not used by one of its neighbors (or the number of colors
is increased).

The function always returns a valid coloring but the optimality (ie number of
colors used) depends on the ordering in which the vertices are considered. The
default is to use "smallest-last" ordering (see @racket[order-smallest-last])
but if @racket[#:order] is a procedure, then it is applied to sort the list of
vertices before the coloring begins.

Only works on undirected graphs.

The returned "colors" are non-negative integers starting from 0. The function
also returns the total number of colors used.}

@defproc[(coloring/brelaz [g graph?]) (hash/c any/c number? #:immutable #f)]{
Returns a "greedy" coloring of the given graph, using the Brelaz vertex ordering heuristic. Note that this function is separate from @racket[coloring/greedy] because the ordering is determined in an online manner.}
          
@defproc[(order-smallest-last [g graph?]) list?]{
Consumes a graph and returns the vertices of the graph in "smallest-last" order. The ordering proceeds as follows. The vertex with the smallest degree is last. Then that vertex is removed and the degrees of the remaining vertices are updated. Then the second to last vertex has the lowest remaining degree and so on.

Only works for undirected graphs.}
                                                                
@defproc[(valid-coloring? [g graph?] [coloring (hash/c any/c number?)]) boolean?]{
Indicates whether the given coloring (a hash that maps a vertex to a color) is valid, meaning that no edge has two vertices of the same color.

This function assumes that a "color" is a number and uses @racket[=] to compare colors.}

@; max flow -------------------------------------------------------------------
@section{Maximum Flow}
@defproc[(maxflow [g graph?] [source any/c] [sink any/c])
         (hash/c (list/c any/c any/c) number?)]{
Computes the maximum flow in graph @racket[g] from @racket[source] to @racket[sink] using the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, which runs in time O(VE^2). Edmonds-Karp is an improvement on the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm in that it uses @racket[fewest-vertices-path] to find an augmenting path in each iteration.
                                   
The function returns a hash mapping an edge to a non-negative number representing the flow along that edge. The returned returned flow is maximal and obeys a few properties:
@itemlist[
  @item{The flow out of the source equals the source into the sink.}
  @item{The flow out of each non-source/sink vertex equals the flow into that vertex.}
  @item{The flow along each edge is <= the edge's capacity (ie, weight).}]
                                   
This function should only be used on directed graphs, otherwise things get double counted.}
                                               
@defproc[(bipartite? [g graph?]) (or/c #f (list/c list? list?))]{
  Determines whether a graph is bipartite using a @racket[dfs]-based 2-@racket[coloring], thus runs in linear time. Returns @racket[#f] if the graph is not bipartite (ie, not 2-colorable), and other wise returns a list of two lists, where each sublist is the "left" and "right" sets of vertices, respectively, in the bipartite graph.}

@defproc[(maximum-bipartite-matching [g graph?]) (listof (list/c any/c any/c))]{
  Returns a list of edges representing the maximum matching of the given bipartite graph. An error is raised if the given graph is not bipartite. Uses @racket[maxflow] to compute the maximum matching.

Note: this is not the Hopcroft-Karp (ie fastest) bipartite matching algorithm.}

@; util fns -------------------------------------------------------------------
@section{Graphviz}
@defproc[(graphviz
          [g graph?]
          [#:output output (or/c output-port? #f) #f]
          [#:colors colors (or/c (hash/c any/c natural-number/c) #f) #f])
         string?]{
Returns the dotfile representation of the given graph (as a string).

The optional color argument maps vertices to colors, where the color
corresponds to the "H" component of an HSV color representation. The given
colors are normalized to be between 0 and 1.0 before generating the graphviz
output, with the maximum specified color value corresponding to 1.0 (the S and
V components are currently unspecifiable and are always 1.0).

Typically, the color argument is the output of a function from
@secref{coloring}, e.g., @racket[(graphviz g #:colors (coloring/brelaz g))].

The optional output argument redirects the output from a
string to the given output port. A string is returned when
the argument is @racket[#f].}
